SETUP : 

- we have docs(5 sentences/ vector)
- we have our own sentence /vector
(all are of same shape)
- we will tell which doc is similar to our sentence


FLOW : 
------
- convert the doc into embeddings 
- convert the sentence into embedding 
- then do semantic search 


- so we have 5 vectors of n dimension(let's say 300) in space 

- now a new vector(300 dim) comes into that space 

- now we will find similarity(using cosine distance) to each vector , whicheever has the most similarity will be the vector 
- then we will convert back to its original form
