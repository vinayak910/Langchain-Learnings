# CHAINS 
---------

- Even a small llm app is made of multiple steps 
- problem : individual executing each step is tedious
- solution : chain together multiple calls to llms and other utilities 
            to automate the entire process

- one input and pipeline triggers multiple actions
- using chains we can not only make sequential pipelines ,
but also complex workflows like parallel and conditionals
