# CHAINS 
---------

- Even a small llm app is made of multiple steps 
- problem : individual executing each step is tedious
- solution : chain together multiple calls to llms and other utilities 
            to automate the entire process

- one input and pipeline triggers multiple actions
- using chains we can not only make sequential pipelines ,
but also complex workflows like parallel and conditionals


1. SIMPLE CHAINS 
2. SEQUENTIAL CHAINS 
3. PARALLEL CHAINS : 
    here ,
    # we get detailed doc on topic (ex : linear regression)
    # we will generate 2 things 
    # 1. NOTES 
    # 2. QUIZ (combine and show to user)

    FLOW : 1 model for notes , other model for quiz ,
    then third model take these 2 as inputs and merge

4. CONDITIONAL CHAINS :
    # based on user input we can direct flow to different chains
    ex : review -> model output pos or neg , then if pos -> chain 1 , else chain 2
