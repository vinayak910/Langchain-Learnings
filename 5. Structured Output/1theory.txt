UNSTRUCTURED OUTPUT 
--------------------------

WE give text as input to llm and get text as output 
- but this text is an unstructured output 
- it is not in well defined format 


STRUCTURED OUTPUT : 
----------------------

- output that is in well defined format 
- enabling easier to parse and work with programmitcally 
- ex JSON output 


NEED OF STRUCTURED OUTPUT 
--------------------------

- LLMs by default give unstructured output (natural language, like paragraphs). 
- That’s useful for humans, but not always for machines or automation pipelines.

1. Data extraction 

- LLMs read unstructured text (documents, emails, reports) → output structured data.
- Benefit: This structured output can be pushed into database automatically 


2. API BUILDING 

- LLMs can act like backends that return structured data instead of natural language
- Example: Weather API (via LLM)

Prompt to LLM:
"What’s the weather in New Delhi right now?"

Unstructured Output (not useful for software):

    "Currently, the weather in New Delhi is 34°C with clear skies and a slight breeze."

structured output : {
  "city": "New Delhi",
  "temperature_celsius": 34,
  "condition": "Clear",
  "wind": "Light breeze"
}

Benefit: Now your frontend app (mobile/web) can directly use this JSON response to display weather in UI cards.


3 AGENT : 

- ex : travel booking agent 
User: “Book me a flight from Delhi to Bangalore on 5th Sep, economy class.”


LLM Structured Output for API call:
{
  "task": "flight_booking",
  "source": "Delhi",
  "destination": "Bangalore",
  "date": "2025-09-05",
  "class": "economy"
}
The agent uses this JSON to call a flight booking API, get results, and then respond.



WAYS TO GET STRUCTURED OUTPUT 
------------------------------

- THere are some llms which can give structured output and some dont 
- we can use .with_stuctured_output() for llms which can give structured output 
- and for those llm which cant we need to use output parsers 


with_stuctured_output()
--------------------------

- using this we can generally create 3 types of structured output 

1. typed dict 
2. pydantic 
3. json schema 

# with_structured_output() in langchain_huggingface does not support Pydantic schemas or function calling.
# This feature is only fully supported in OpenAI / Anthropic / Mistral integrations, not in HuggingFace models.
