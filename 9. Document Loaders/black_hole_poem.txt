Black Hole

In the hush between the star’s last breath,
where light forgets the way to fly,
a doorway opens—silent, deep—
an eye that does not blink at sky.

No trumpet sounds, no wildfire roars,
no warning written in the blue;
just gravity, a patient hand,
pulling all stories inward—true.

It eats the maps of constellations,
folds time like paper, neat and tight,
and keeps the secrets of the cosmos
locked behind a curtain of night.

Around its rim the universe
glows—an amber, burning ring;
a halo forged of falling suns,
a bright, impossible thing.

And there I stand, a speck of wonder,
thinking: even fear can be
so strangely beautiful—
a dark infinity.

For in that endless, hungry silence,
I learn what stars already know:
to love is to surrender light,
to fall—
and still to glow.
