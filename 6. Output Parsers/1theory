# OUTPUT PARSERS 
------------------

- We studied about open source llm and closed source
- generally , closed source have the capability for giving structured ouput 
- but open source llm are not that much capable of giving structured output
- but we can use some techniques to make them give structured output

# Common output parsers techniques:
------------------------------------
1. String Output Parser:
    - takes llm response as string and returns it as is
    - so what is the use ? 
    - useful when you want to process the string response later in your code
    - or when you want to chain multiple llm calls and pass the output of one as input to another

2. Json Output Parser:
    - tries to parse the llm response as json
    - useful when you want to extract specific fields from the llm response
    - or when you want to validate the llm response against a json schema
