Basically the input given to model to generate/guide its output are prompts


2 types of prompts
--------------------
1. text based 
2. multi modal prompts : 

	- maybe text + image (just like in chatgpt) 
	- sound 
	- video 

in this lec: we will more focus on text


- Prompts are super imp , because models output is very sensitive to the prompt


Static vs dynamic prompts 
--------------------------


: Till now , we write prompts simply just like : 
	- write a poem on river 

ques : is this the right way ? 
	
	- no , in real world the user who is using application will type the prompt , which will be given to chatmodel/llm 
	


ideally , we want user dont directly type anything

- so prepare template
